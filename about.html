            <p>What's so great about combining the worlds
             of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate deve
             lopers who turned their love for software into a culinary adventure.
              After years of coding by day and cooking by night, they decided to 
              merge
            their two passions and create something extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering
            a menu full of creative, tech-inspired dishes. Whether you're a
            tech enthusiast or a food lover, our offerings 
            are designed to satisfy both your appetite and your curiosity.</p>
            <p>
             Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie,
             two friends who met at a hackathon and discovered a
            shared love for innovative cuisine. With a background 
             in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, 
             they embarked on a journey to deliver delicious,
             tech-themed dishes to the community.
